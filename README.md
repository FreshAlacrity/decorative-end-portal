# Decorative End Portal Datapack for Minecraft Java Edition 1.18.1
Makes it possible to make **purely cosmetic** end portal (technically end gateway) blocks in survival Minecraft, just for aesthetic/decorative purposes. Works in survival and creative modes, and players can pass through the blocks with no obstruction or effect. The gateway block cannot be broken by players in either Creative or Survival by the usual means, so I included a way to reverse it as well.

## Installation
put the entire repository either as it is or as a .zip in the datapacks directory inside your Minecraft world save. The 'data' directory needs to be inside a directory inside the datapacks directory; for example:  
`.minecraft\saves\New World\datapacks\decorative-end-portal\data`

You can download a .zip of this pack and see screenshots at https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/decorative-end-portal/

## Usage In-Game
Drop an eye of ender onto tinted glass with a block of iron underneath it to make a decorative end gateway block, and then drop a snowball on it the same way if you want to turn it back. Drop is by default Q - don't throw it like you would with right-click to find a Stronghold. Droppers will work to automate making the decorative portals, but Dispensers won't. It'll make a little chat message and sound effect for people nearby when it works. :)

## Notes
I may add a way to make proper End Portal blocks in the future since these are technically End Gateway blocks, they just have the same texture/optical effect. I haven't figured out a way to make those purely decorative (maybe by preventing players from entering the block somehow?) or balanced, though. If you have a suggestion for how to make the in-game process/ritual for creating portal blocks in a more immersive or less confusing way - or really any suggestions for how to make it better - let me know!

Tested on Minecraft Java Edition **1.18.1** but it might work on other versions - feel free to try it at your own risk. ;)
